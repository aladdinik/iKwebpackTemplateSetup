	/**************/

+\  create a new folder just for test. And move App.test.js into it.
	+\  you can rename it or modify it as you see fit.
	+\  iK try using the default jest unit testing. But if you cannot than you can do install chai and sinon to make it easier for you.
		+\  not ideal to use mocha yet, since you have to npm run eject create react app.
	+\  copy and paste the test syntax structure from your file so that you have a good idea what the test structure could be like first, plus saving you time typing.

    +\ import {render, fireEvent, screen} from '@testing-library/react'
    =eg. to use react testing library for your testing.
        +\ iK? however you might need the:  import '@testing-library/jest-dom'

	/**************/
1+ npm install react-app-polyfill
2+ import 'react-app-polyfill/ie11';   =VIP on the first line of ./src/index.js
	+\  if you also want IE9 and IE10 support than replace "ie11" with "ie9" as this will support all three IE.
+\ if you want language features than check their page for code as it does the same thing but some other things to which I do not know much about, however their was some inconsistency which is why I did not include it here, iK read my note3 docs for more details.


	/**************/
/* Using your kIK.js personal js codes */
	/**************/
+\  if you want to use your personal js file kiK.js , than include it in the ./src folder .
	1+ Put export in the kiK.js file
		+\  eg. export const IK = (function(root) { â€¦
	2+ import {IK} from './kiK.js';  on whatever .js file you want to use it on.
	+\  BIM however it is probably best not to include it in your project as you will likely not be using all those function. 
		+\  so it is best recommended to take snippets codes for when you need them.

/* favicon.ico and logo192 file for <title> */
	/**************/
1+ ./public folder replace favicon.ico file with an image you want for the <title> . Do so by renaming the image file favicon.ico
2+ check ./public/manifest.json file and make sure favicon.ico section details is correct.
+\  do the same for logo192.png file too.
+\  iK? I think you could remove ./public/logo512.png file since I do not know what it is doing.
